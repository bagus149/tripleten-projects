## Project Description:
An insurance company wants to address several issues with the help of machine learning. You are also asked to evaluate the feasibility of these tasks.
- Task 1: Find clients similar to specific client criteria. This task will facilitate the company's marketing efforts.
- Task 2: Predict whether new clients are likely to make insurance claims. Is the model's prediction better than that of a dummy model?
- Task 3: Predict the amount of insurance claims that new clients might receive using a linear regression model.
- Task 4: Protect the personal data of clients without compromising the model from the previous tasks. It is crucial to develop data transformation algorithms that can prevent the misuse of clients' personal information if it falls into the wrong hands. This is called data masking or data obfuscation. However, data protection procedures should also be considered to ensure that the quality of the machine learning model does not deteriorate. Here, you do not need to choose the best model; just prove that your algorithm works accurately.

## Data:
- Features: gender, age, income, and the number of family members of the insured individuals.
- Target: the amount of claims received by the insured individuals over the last five years.
