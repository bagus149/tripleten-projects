## Project Description:
A telecommunications company wants to predict their customer churn rate. If it's known that a customer is about to leave their subscription, they plan to offer promotional codes and special package options.

## Data:
The available data consists of several files obtained from different sources:
- _contact.csv_ - contact information
- _personal.csv_ - personal client data
- _internet.csv_ - information about internet services
- _phone.csv_ - information about phone services

In each file, there is a unique _customerID_ obtained from each client. The contracts are effective as of February 1, 2020.

## Libraries:
* _pandas_
* _sklearn_
