## Project Description:
In this project, a supermarket franchise wants to determine whether Data Science can assist them in legal matters by ensuring that they do not sell age-restricted products to underage customers. Taking into account the following:

* Stores in this franchise are equipped with cameras at the checkout area that will trigger a signal when someone purchases an age-restricted product.
* Computer vision methods can be used to determine a person's age from a photo.

Your task is to build and evaluate a model to verify a person's age.

## Dataset:
Labels file:
* file_name: photo name
* real_age: the age of the person associated with the photo file

## Target
Train and evaluate a model to determine the age of every customer who arrives.
