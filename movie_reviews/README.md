## Project Description:
A community of classic film enthusiasts is developing a system to filter and categorize movie reviews. Their main mission is to train a model that can automatically detect negative reviews. They are using IMDb movie review data with polarity labels to create a model capable of classifying reviews as positive or negative. This model should achieve an F1 score of at least 0.85.

## Dataset:
The data is from Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, dan Christopher Potts. (2011). Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis. The 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2011).

## Target:
