## Project Description:
A taxi company is collecting historical data on airport taxi orders. To attract more drivers during peak hours, it is necessary to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Create a model for such a prediction.

The RMSE metric on the test set should not exceed 48.

## Data:
- "_datetim_": the column to be transformed into an index.
- "_num_orders_": the number of orders.

## Target:
Create a model that predicts the number of taxis for the next hour, and the RMSE value should not exceed 48.

## Libraries:
- _pandas_
- _math_
- _numpy_
- _matplotlib_
- _sklearn_
- _lightGBM_
