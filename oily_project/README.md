## Project Description:
In this project, we are tasked with finding a suitable location for drilling a new oil well. The steps to select a new location are as follows:
- Gather parameters for drilling oil wells in several selected regions: oil quality and oil reserve volume.
- Create a model capable of predicting the oil reserve volume in a new well.
- Choose the oil well with the highest estimated value.
- Select the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil well.

The data used is oil data from three regions. From this data, a model will be created to assist in the selection of a region.

# Data:
- _id_ - Unique ID for the oil well
- _f0, f1, f2_ - Three feature points (the specific meaning is not important, but the features themselves are significant)
- _product_ - Oil reserve volume in the well (in thousands of barrels).

# Libraries:
- _pandas_
- _numpy_
- _matplotlib_
- _sklearn_
